# Integrated Data Project: Advertising Campaign Planning

## Description
This is the first integrated project of the curriculum, serving as a capstone that synthesizes programming, data manipulation, and statistical validation. The project analyzes complex datasets to identify consumer patterns and provide a data-backed foundation for a strategic advertising campaign.

## Project's Objective
The goal is to apply the full stack of acquired Python and Data Science skills to extract actionable marketing insights, validate hypotheses through statistical testing, and design a targeted advertising strategy based on historical data.

## Results
- **Pattern Identification:** Discovery of high-conversion demographics and optimal engagement windows.
- **Strategic Plan:** A comprehensive proposal for an advertising campaign targeting specific user segments.
- **Data-Backed Decisions:** All marketing recommendations are supported by calculated P-values and visual trend analysis.

## Methodology
The project follows an end-to-end analytical workflow as of 2026:
1.  **Data Consolidation:** Merging and cleaning multiple data sources to create a unified dataset.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying correlations between user behavior and purchase intent.
3.  **Statistical Verification:** Using T-tests to ensure that observed differences between target groups are statistically significant.
4.  **Campaign Planning:** Translating statistical "winners" into a marketing roadmap.

## Utilized Tools
- **Data Treatment:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) & [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
- **Statistical Testing:** [SciPy](https://scipy.org) (Inferential statistics).
- **Visual Analytics:** [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) & [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org).
- **Environment:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org).

## Acquired/Developed Abilities
- **Holistic Data Integration:** Combining cleaning, manipulation, and statistics into a single workflow.
- **Marketing Analytics:** Applying data science specifically to business growth and advertising ROI.
- **Scientific Validation:** Moving beyond visual assumptions to mathematical certainty using hypothesis testing.
- **Strategic Reporting:** Communicating technical data as high-level business strategy.

## Upgrades to be Made
- [ ] Incorporate Machine Learning models to predict campaign churn rates.
- [ ] Integrate real-time API data from social media platforms.
- [ ] Create an automated PDF report generator for the final campaign proposal.

## How to Run It
You can run the project files in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab
1. Upload the `.ipynb` files directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Local Environment (VS Code)
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.orgdownloads/) installed.
2. Install the **Jupyter Extension** in VS Code.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and select your Python interpreter.
